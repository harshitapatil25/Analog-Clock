# Analog-Clock

This project is a simple analog watch implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog watch displays the current time with an hour, minute, and second hand, updating every second. The analog watch is designed to be visually appealing and functional. The clock's face is styled with CSS to give it a classic look, while JavaScript handles the dynamic updates of the clock hands. This project is perfect for those who are looking to understand the basics of combining these three web technologies to create interactive and visually engaging components.
